I am currently a joint PhD student at USTC and CityU, supervised by [Prof.Enhong Chen](http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~cheneh/) at BDAA Lab, [Prof.Tong Xu](http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~tongxu/) at BDAA Lab, and [Prof.Xiangyu Zhao](https://zhaoxyai.github.io/) at AML lab. Prior to starting my doctoral studies, I received my Bachelor degree from Shandong University in 2022.

My current research interests include large language models and multimodal recommendation systems.
